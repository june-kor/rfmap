<p align="center"> Software helping in Fingerprinting RF Signals, the software works leveraging modern AI methods to classify and analyse RF (Radio Frequency) signals.

<br>
The package is written modular so as to be able to add new AI 'plugins' into the package's classification methods. All Research credits goes to the authors who created the implemented AI papers.

## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Identifying from which device a signal originates is the key to authenticating wit the said device. In modern days the security measures implemented on the software layer are easily spoofed using various cyber profiling mechanics. All the techniques involved in recognizing the source device happens at the software layer,which can be manipulated by third party to create counterfeit devices. Thus a technology to recognize devices at a hardware level is required. The technology should be able to detect unique electronic hardware features of the source device and should be able to classify it accordingly.

The Implemented software is able to classify and create hardware related fingerprints of device RF traffic from an existing group of pre recognized transmitters. 

RF Fingerprinting is the key to reducing the chances of counterfeit authentication of devices. This will help in creating secure communication channels.


## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

This section is used to describe potential solutions.

Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been

completed, and understood, it becomes easier to provide a solution for solving the problem.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- What are the dependencies of your project?

- Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms

- Explain why each limitation exists

- Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire.

- Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your project, and if

appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Write about what you could not develop during the course of the Hackathon; and about what your project can achieve

in the future.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
