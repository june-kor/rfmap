***ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM OPERATIONS***

Problem Description: Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations

1. Every radio signal transmission can be uniquely characterized due to randomness inmanufacturing process, origin and type of components etc. This process of radiofingerprinting is a process that identifies any other radio transmitter by the "fingerprint"that characterizes its signal transmission and is hard to imitate. An electronicfingerprint makes it possible to identify a wireless device by its radio transmissioncharacteristics. Radio fingerprinting is commonly used to prevent cloning.
2. Participants will develop an application using any technology or transformationprocess to create this electronic fingerprint. The application will listen for RFtransmissions and create the fingerprint, which can have various fields of varied size,storing information about the transmitter. This fingerprint will be matched with datasets of existing fingerprints and will bring out total or partial match (75% or above).
3. For a new fingerprint the data set will be stored along with date-time stamp and location. Resources
